## Introduction

In this project, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of Node.js and how it can be used to build web applications. I will be using popular libraries and tools like Express.js for building web APIs, Nodemon for development workflow automation, and Swagger for API documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Explore the project and experiment with Node.js and its dependencies.

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

Please refer to the respective documentation links for detailed information on each dependency.

## Running Tests

To run tests for this project, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used. Follow the steps below:

1. Install Dependencies: Before running tests, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install

2. Run Tests: Execute the following command to run the tests:

    npm test

  This will run Jest in watch mode, allowing you to interactively run tests and view results.

3. Generate Coverage Report: To generate a coverage report, use the following command:

    npm run test:coverage

  This will create a coverage report in the coverage directory. Open coverage/index.html in your browser to view detailed coverage information.

4. Interpret Results:

  - Successful Tests: When all tests pass, you will see a summary in the terminal.
  - Coverage Report: Open the coverage report to visualize which parts of your code are covered by tests.

Feel free to explore Jest's documentation for more advanced testing features: Jest Documentation.
